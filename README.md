# Guide to run code:

**Run the following files with the following command:**

```
python3 name.py
```
Replace name.py with 
+ ```calc.py``` is for calculating sampling error
+ ```n_size.py``` is for calculating sample size
+ ```stats.py``` is for refering to Confidence Interval 

I made this 4 fun since I need some other easier tools to use in my statistics test :/ I don't want to use my calculator tbh for some parts I can't StartCrunch
